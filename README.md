# Imap
Interactive mapping in R

Install or upgrade with:

    if (!require('devtools')) install.packages('devtools')  # Get devtools if you don't already have it.
    
    devtools::install_github("John-R-Wallace/Imap")
```diff 
- After upgrading, restarting R may be needed before the help pages will work (Imap.rdb is not actually corrupt).
```
