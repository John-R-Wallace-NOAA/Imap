# Imap
Interactive mapping in R

Install or upgrade with:

    install.packages('devtools')  # Get devtools if you don't already have it.
    
    devtools::install_github("John-R-Wallace/Imap")

Note that since this package is using old style manual files, it appears that a restarting of R may be needed after an upgrade.
